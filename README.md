+ It does the naming for you if you want
+ you can return the names of error codes, custom messages and images (for save database).
+ you can upload PDF,images or other.


how use ? 

1) Just change upload folder(If you want you can send the function while calling)
2) just send file extention. (you can send all file paths. open image.class.php and add your extention)
3) Check return array. i will send image names
4) If you want, you can save the names I have sent to the database.


Note: if you want send text or image  you can. just open ajax.js and add like I did add image. 

THANKS FOR USE.


* You should Change save folder in image.class.php (If you want you can send the function while calling)
